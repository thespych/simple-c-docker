# simple-c-docker
A very simple image for writing basic C and C++ code. For anyone without Ubuntu 24.04 or who doesn't have the following installed locally:

- Ubuntu Build Essentials (mainly GCC, G++, and Make)
- GDB
- Valgrind
- Vim
- Less (Terminal Pager)
- Tmux
- Man

In addition to the image, I have provided 3 files to quickly build the image, depending on your OS. After getting Docker up and running,
simply run one of the files to build the image.

- Run `simple-c-linux.sh` for Linux
- Run `simple-c-macos.sh` for MacOS
- Run `simple-c-windows.sh` for Windows
