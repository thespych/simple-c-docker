# simple-c-docker

Docker Hub Repo: https://hub.docker.com/r/thespych/simple-c

A very simple image for writing basic C and C++ code. For anyone without Ubuntu 24.04 or who doesn't have the following installed locally:

- Ubuntu Build Essentials (mainly GCC, G++, and Make)
- GDB
- Valgrind
- Vim
- pkg-config
- Less (Terminal Pager)
- Tmux
- Man

In addition to the image, I have provided 3 files to quickly build the image from a terminal if you're not super familiar with Docker. Just download/copy whatever file matches your OS and then run it from the directory you want to work in.

- Run `simple-c-linux.sh` for Linux
- Run `simple-c-macos.sh` for MacOS
- Run `simple-c-windows.bat` for Windows
